<h4>Purpose</h4>
Find alternative method to using Google Distance Matrix API and find an API that allows for batch processing of coordinate pairs or addresses

<h4>Tools</h4>
Python, Cloudera Machine Learning, Jupyter, Impala SQL
<br>
At the time of creating this project section, Google Distance Matrix API costs $5.00 per 1000 coordinate. The project I was working on the goal was to finding driving distances between millions of locations. Google Distance Matrix API is not a viable solution and similarly, other APIs like Bing also cost per API call for one driving distance calculation.

<h4>The World of Open Source GIS API</h4>
<br>
I initially found <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=3/38.01/-95.84">OpenStreetMap</a> which is a open source map supported by individual contributers and major organizations like Apple, University College of London and many more. I tried using Selenium to crawl OpenStreetMap, but that was not advisable as it went against the terms of use. I also tried web crawling on Goolge Distance Matrix API, but same issues with terms of service. 
<br>
<i>However...</i> After some direction from my mentor, I was able to focus my efforts to finding the API Open Street Map uses. 
 <a href="https://project-osrm.org/"> Open Source Routing Machine</a> proivides the API to OpenStreetMap data. 
 The great thing about OSRM is that it offers batch processing for 100 coordinates at at time, generates a 100 x 100 matrix for dual driving distance between coordinates, offers time between coordinates and is open source. 
 The next challenging problem was coordinating the location coordinates with location ids as these were in seperate tables. 
 The existing distances were caclulated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_the_crow_flies">crow flying distance</a> which requires no API and only a calculation.

<i>Improving the distance calculation from crow flying distnce to driving distance could allow better comparison of churn at locations or user preference.</i>
